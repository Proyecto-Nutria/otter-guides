title: System Design Exercise
---

In this type of exercise, you will be expected to generate a high-level design of a system,
showing its different components and infrastructure considering both sides (front-end and back-end). You will usually have between 30 min to 1 hr to complete this exercise.
Although giving a high-level design is the main focus of this exercise,
you may also be asked to explain some parts in detail, for example:
How will you create the REST API? or which technology you will prefer for some tasks and why?
