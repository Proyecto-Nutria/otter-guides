### Tips that apply to any type of exercise:

- **Clarify the problem** - To be sure that the interviewer and you are on the same page is important to clarify the problem by asking questions (ask as many questions as you need) or by creating some examples.

- **Be aware of edge cases** - It is important to communicate to the interviewer of any edge cases you find and be ready to talk through each of them, often in the industry the only bugs that are found in code are due to not considering edge cases that break the core logic of the solution. Even if the interviewer tells you not to consider them for the implementation, the fact that you thought about them is a positive signal and is something they will definitely write down on their notes.

- **Think out loud** - Sharing all your thoughts to the interviewer during the whole process
is beneficial for 2 main reasons:
  1.  Allows the interviewer to understand your thought process
  1.  The interviewer will be able to provide high-level guidance/feedback to you if you are
  on the wrong track, which will save you important minutes. Try to consider your interviewer as
  your colleague, don't be afraid of asking what do they think about your thoughts.

- **Test your solution** - An interview is actually a small simulation of how you would work in a real/production scenario, testing is a crucial part of the development process and helps us to guarantee the correct behavior of the systems. Showing that you test your solution in an interview is indeed a positive signal, which demonstrates that you write tests and never assume that your code is perfect!
