---

As an interviewer, your main task is to assess the interviewee's performance. However, there are many other aspects to consider for achieving this goal and providing a good experience for the person. Below you will find a table with general tips for assuming the role of an interviewer, based on this [Cheatsheet (Interviewer)](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/interviewer-cheatsheet/).

#### Symbol

- ✅ = Do
- ❌ = Do Not
- ⚠️ = Situational

### Before the Interview

|  | Situation |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Be in a quiet room.. |
| ✅ | Check that you have a good internet connection. |
| ⚠️ | Have good lighting (if using a webcam). |
| ✅ | Test that the audio (and webcam) are working correctly. |
| ✅ | Read the interviewee's resume to understand their background. |
| ✅ | Familiarize yourself with the text/code editor to be used (we suggest Google Docs). |
| ⚠️ | For the final feedback, we suggest opening and using [Feedback Helper](https://proyecto-nutria.github.io/feedback-helper/).. |

### Introduction

|  | 	Situation |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Ask if you can be heard and seen correctly. |
| ⚠️ | Use other platforms if there are connection problems. |
| ✅ | Introduce yourself briefly to the candidate and give them time to do the same. |
| ⚠️ | In the presentation, if you are not part of any company (or were only for an *internship*), you can omit this part in the introduction if you are uncomfortable with it. |
| ✅ | Give a quick explanation of the interview format (stages, duration, tools, etc.). |
| ❌ | Allow them to start asking questions about their introduction. |
| ❌ | Allow the candidate to take too much time in their introduction.|

### During the interview

|  | Situation |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Keep an eye on the time to switch sections or provide help. |
| ✅ | Speak clearly and ask if they understood any question or problem described. |
| ✅ | Encourage the interviewee to communicate everything they think or are unsure about. |
| ⚠️ | Give hints (allow the interviewee to think and challenge themselves, do not release them quickly). |
| ⚠️ | Allow the interviewee to be silent (if they ask for time to organize thoughts it's fine, but the objective of the interview is to understand their thought process, so long periods of silence should be avoided, otherwise, the objective could not be achieved). |
| ✅ | Write feedback or relevant time stamps to say at the end (we suggest using [Feedback Helper](https://proyecto-nutria.github.io/feedback-helper/)). |

### Final questions

|  | Situation |
| --- | --- |
| ⚠️ | Skip this section of final questions (if you do not have real experience or are not comfortable, although you can *role-play* by giving "vague" answers based on those received by others). |
| ✅ | Allow questions about yourself, your career, your experience, or your company. |
| ⚠️ | Skip questions (in case it is a sensitive topic or you do not know the answer). |
| ❌ | Break NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreements) on sensitive company matters. |
| ✅ | Ask if the answer given (especially on technical topics) is clear. |
| ⚠️ | Go over 60 min (although it can be interesting, you should try to be realistic with the time limit for the interview). |

### Feedback

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ | Write the final comments. |
| ⚠️  | Ask in which language they prefer the feedback (if more than one common language is spoken). |
| ✅ | Copy and paste the feedback into the shared document so the other person can read it. |
| ✅ | Explain the comments made, asking if there are any doubts or if something is not clear at each point. |
| ✅ | Thank them for their time and wish them the best. |
