`cpbooster` provides the following command to automatically
**submit** your code to any supported Online Judge. See [Supported Online Judges](#supported-online-judges).

```txt
cpb submit <filePath> [url]
```

or its alias which is just `s`.

```txt
cpb s <filePath> [url]
```

#### Demo

<div className="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/demos/submit.gif')} />
</div>

## Requirements

- [Login](#login) with `cpb login <OnlineJudgeName>`
- [Specify URL](#how-to-specify-the-url) in file or as argument.
- [Configure Language Aliases](#how-to-configure-language-aliases) for each platform and language.

:::note
`cpbooster` uses a specific chromium binary that gets installed automatically in OS-specific cache
folders:

- `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright` on Windows
- `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` on MacOS
- `~/.cache/ms-playwright` on Linux

according to [playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/installation/)
:::

## Login

Before you can use the `submit` command you will need to login
to the Online Judge where you will submit your code.

```txt
cpb login <OnlineJudgeName>
```


For example, to login to AtCoder I would execute the following command

```txt
cpb login atcoder
```

The name can be written in upper or lowercase or mixed, it doesn't matter.

:::note
The `submit` command will automatically open the login page
if it detects that you are not logged in, then it will continue
to submit your code. So, the `submit` command will execute at most 2
actions.
:::

:::note information
`cpbooster` will NOT send any account information
to anyone else, all it does is, save your cookies
and session information like any browser does locally (in
`$HOME/.cpbooster/cpbooster-session.json`).

## How To Specify The URL

When you run `cpb submit` you can provide the `url` in **2** different ways:


### 1. As A Command Argument

You can specify the `url` after the `<filePath>` in the `submit` command.

For example:

```txt
cpb s A.DistanceAndAxis.cpp "https://codeforces.com/contest/1401/problem/A"
```

### 2. As A Commented Line In The Source File

Another way to specify the `url` is by writing the string `problem-url:` followed by
the `url` as a commented line somewhere in your source file. In this way
you will be able to submit your code without adding extra argument in the
command, just like in the [demo](#demo).

For example:

##### `A.DistanceAndAxis.cpp`

```cpp
// problem-url: https://codeforces.com/contest/1401/problem/A
int main() {
  ...
}
```
:::important
This line will be automatically added when you clone a contest with `cpb clone`.
So, no need to do anything manually during a contest.
:::

:::note
If you specify the url in both ways (argument and commented line), the one
specified as argument will be used.

## How To Configure Language Aliases

The language alias is the **ID** of the language for each Online Judge.
See [How To Find Language IDs](#how-to-find-language-ids). For example, in Codeforces,
the alias for `cpp` can be any of:

|ID| Name|
|--|-----|
|42|GNU G++11 5.1.0|
|50|GNU G++14 6.4.0|
|54|GNU G++17 7.3.0|

Let's say we want to submit our `cpp` file using G++17, then
we should specify it
in <a href={"/docs/configuration#languageslangaliases-objectonlinejudgename-string"} style={{color: 'white'}}>`languages.cpp.aliases.codeforces`</a>
like this:

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "cpp": {
      "aliases": {
        "codeforces": "54"
      }
    }
}
```

### How To Find Language IDs

To find language IDs follow the next steps:

#### 1. Navigate to the online judge page where the language dropdown is located

Some online judges use group of radio buttons or some other type of selectors for languages,
like Uva Online Judge.

For example, in Codeforces and AtCoder you could go to any problem's page like:

- https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc196/tasks/abc196_a
<div className="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/atcoder_dropdown.png')} />
</div>
- https://codeforces.com/contest/1401/problem/A
<div className="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/codeforces_dropdown.png')} />
</div>

#### 2. Open the inspection tool

Usually to open the inspection tool, you can `right click` in the page,
and then click on `Inspect`.

<div className="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/inspect_right_click.png')} />
</div>
<br />
<div className="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/inspect_tool.png')} />
</div>

#### 3. Locate the `<select>` tag

Also, note that we could also be looking for radio buttons,
for example: Uva Online Judge uses Radio Buttons instead of a dropdown menu.

:::tip
Press `ctrl+f` to open the search box, and type `<select`. This will help you
to find the tag faster
:::

<div className="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/search_select.png')} />
</div>

#### 4. Locate the `value` of the language you wish to use

For this, we will need to unfold the contents of the `<select>` tag to see
the options. This is done by clicking on the small arrow to the left.

<div className="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/select_options.png')} />
</div>

The content of the `value` property of each option is what `cpbooster` uses as **Alias**.
So, now you can just copy and paste the value into your configuration file.

For example, if you want to use `C++ (Clang 10.0.0)` for `cpp` files in AtCoder, you could write
your configuration file as follows.

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "cpp": {
      "aliases": {
        "atcoder": "4004"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
