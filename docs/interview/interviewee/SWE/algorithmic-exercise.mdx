In this type of exercise, you will be presented with a problem that will require you to use your
computer science skills like algorithms & data structures, Big O notation for time and memory
complexity, creativity. The main goal will be to get to an efficient solution that effectively
solves the problem considering the given constraints.
You will usually have between 30 min to 1 hr to complete this exercise.

### Tips to succeed in the algorithmic exercise

- Follow the tips given in the [Technical Exercise](../technical-exercise) section
- Become an expert on the programming language that you choose for your interviews
  - [Sololearn: Learn to Code](https://www.sololearn.com/home)
  - [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)
- Practice your problem-solving skills with online platforms like:
  - [Coding Practice | Coding Challenges - InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/) (most recommended due to its organized learning paths)
  - [Technical Interviews and Assessments - CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/)
  - [LeetCode - The World's Leading Online Programming Learning Platform](https://leetcode.com/)
  - [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
  - [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- Watch how real coding interviews are conducted

- Do mock interviews

  - [Practice Live Job Interviews - For Free](https://www.pramp.com/#/)
  - Use our otter-buddy bot in our discord channel

- Write high-quality/production code
  - Avoid global variables
  - Use clear and concise names for variables and methods
  - Modulate your code (try to create helper methods that may be reusable)
  - Use blank spaces between operators, commas, semicolons, â€¦ (just like a linter would suggest)
- The following flow diagram will guide you step by step through solving an algorithmic problem,
  practice following those steps while solving a problem on your own or when doing mock interviews.
