title: Ask Anything

This is usually the last part of an interview and possibly the shortest, however,
it is as important as the other sections, this is the opportunity for you to show some
interest in working for the company, so doing some research about the project you were
assigned to or any other detail about the company will definitely come in handy.


:::caution
NOT demonstrating interest might become a reason to not select you, even if you did well in
all the other parts of the interview
