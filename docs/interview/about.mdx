title: Technical Interview
---

In a real technical interview, the interviewee will have from 45 to 60 minutes to show to the interviewer the required signals 
that him fit the requirements of the role. During this time his interviewer will be evaluating him based on the following:
* **Analytical skills**: Did he need much help solving the problem? How optimal was his solution? How long did it take him 
to arrive at a solution? If he had to design/architect a new solution, did he structure the problem well and think 
through the tradeoffs of different decisions?
* **Coding skills**: Was he able to successfully translate his algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and well-organized? Did 
he think about potential errors? Did he use good style?
* **Technical knowledge / Computer Science fundamentals**: Do he has a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant 
technologies?
* **Experience**: Has he made good technical decisions in the past? Has he built interesting, challenging projects? Has he shown 
drive, initiative, and other important factors?
* **Culture fit / Communication skills**: Do his personality and values fit with the company and team? Did he communicate well 
with his interviewer?

Usually, the technical interview is splitted in 3 parts:
1. **Behavioral Questions** (5~15 min): With this the company want to know his personality, to understand his resume more deeply 
(also is a way to know if he lied there), to see how he handle hypothetical situations, and just to ease him into an interview.
2. **Coding Problem** (25~40 min): He will be given a technical problem by the interviewer, write code in a real-time collaborative 
editor (remote) or on a whiteboard / paper sheets (on-site) to solve it. He need to solve the problem, communicate his ideas properly 
(think aloud), walk through his code, and review/test anything that he propose.
3. **Ask Anything** (5~10 min): At the end of the interview he will have some time to make questions to the interviewer, with this 
he will show his interest to join in the company and how will he fit into.
