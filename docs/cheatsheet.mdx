1. `cpbooster` comes with a short alias command called `cpb` to avoid writing the long command each time
1. Automatically clone sample testcases files with corresponding source code files with template loaded into a desired directory
   - `cpb clone` waits for competitive companion plugin to send parsed data for each problem
1. Create source files with corresponding template loaded
   - `cpb create a.py` creates single file with corresponding template loaded based on file extension
   - `cpb create {a..n}.cpp` creates multiple consecutive files from "a.cpp" to "n.cpp"
   - `cpb create {a...n}.cpp` same as previous command (Any amount of dots greater than 1 work)
   - `cpb create {a-n}.cpp` same as previous command (Single dash also works)
   - `cpb create /some/path/a.cpp` creates "a.cpp" in the specified path instead of current location
   - `cpb create /some/path/{a-n}.cpp` creates "a.cpp ... n.cpp" in the specified path instead of current location
1. Test your code against sample testcases quickly

   - `cpb test mycode.cpp` test your program against all available test cases
   - `cpb test mycode.cpp -t 1` test your program against the test case with the given id
   - `cpb test /some/path/mycode.cpp` test a program that is not located in your current location

   Supported results:

   - **AC** (Accepted)
   - **WA** (Wrong Answer) Shows differences between accepted output and your output beautifully
   - **TLE** (Time Limit Exceeded)
   - **RTE** (Runtime Error)
   - **CE** (Compilation Error)

1. Run code with your own debugging flags easily
   - `cpb test mycode.cpp -d` to use keyboard as input
   - `cpb test mycode.cpp -t 2 -d` to use a test case file as input
   - `cpb test /some/path/mycode.cpp -d` debug a program that is not located in your current location
1. Submit your code from the terminal really quickly.
   - `cpb submit mycode.cpp` submits your file to the corresponding judge.
1. open a new terminal in the contest directory immediately after cloning it

   - List of **supported terminals** for this feature:
     - konsole
     - xterm
     - gnome-terminal
     - deepin-terminal
     - terminal (MacOS)
     - kitty
     - vscode
       - I recommend adding this setting to your vscode `settings.json` so that green doesn't look to bright:
         `"workbench.colorCustomizations" : { "terminal.ansiGreen":"#5b8a3a" }`
