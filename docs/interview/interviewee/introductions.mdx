In this part of the interview,
the interviewer is expected to explain to you the structure of the interview and then give a self-introduction.
On your side, it is expected that you introduce yourself as well, for that we provide you with the following tips.

## Tips for your self-introduction:
- **Keep it brief** - Introduce in around 2 min, this will leave some time for the interviewer to ask questions about yourself and at the same time you won’t reduce the designated time for the technical exercise.

- **Tell a story** - Talk about past experience, current experience, and career goals. You could answer the question “Tell me about your journey into tech” when being asked to introduce yourself

- **Keep It Simple and Sweet** - The time you have to introduce yourself is short, organize your speech in a way that you showcase all the relevant things you have done.

- **Be natural** - Do not memorize your speech like a robot, it is better to just grab the key parts and paraphrase them in the order you already chose.
